IPD_Morality
============

Run Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments. Judge the bots according to various morality metrics.

If you define your own bots or morality metrics, I would love for you to let me know about them at `tscizzle@gmail.com`. Also, if you see any mistakes, ways to improve, or just comments in general, feel free to contact me by that email as well.

Usage
-----

Fill in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block at the bottom of `arena.py` (an example is given in `arena.py` already), navigate in your terminal to the root directory of IPD_Morality, and run `python arena.py`.

Some Cool Stuff
---------------

Robin Berjon made http://darobin.github.io/ipd-morality/, a cool interface for running tournaments, and it even includes an interesting evolutionary variation.
